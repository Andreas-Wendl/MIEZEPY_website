### Opening the GUI

Right now, there is only the option to start the program via the command line. Open your command line, for example the Anaconda-Bash. Activate your python3 environment. 

```bash
activate py37
```

Run python and execute:

```bash
$ from miezepy.mieze import Mieze
$ Mieze(True)
```
