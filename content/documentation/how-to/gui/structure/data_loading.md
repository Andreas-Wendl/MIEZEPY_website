## Data import
 The functions of this page are described in order of there usage:
 
 1: New measurements can be created. One measurement should contain all data, which form one S(Q,t)-curve in the end.

 2: When the measurement is created and selected, the containing data in form of .tof-files can be added or removed in this tab.

 3: The intensity in each .tof-file is previewed, when it is selected. 

 4: The metadata of each measurement can be edited in this screen. Changes to the imported data can be made by writing in the edit-field. A single number overwrites all instances of this metadata-keyword. A comma-separated list with the length of the number of .tof-files overwrites each value seperately.

 5: After changes have been made to 2. and 4., they are transferred to the measurement by the "Populate the dataset"-Button.

 6: An overview of all measurements is given. The reference and backgroud measurements can be selected.

 7: After all measurements are imported the whoele dataset can be validated and loaded to the environment.
