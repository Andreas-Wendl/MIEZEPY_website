## The Masks Tab
New masks can be created and existing masks edited.
1: The drop-down menu allows to select existing masks for editing or to create a new mask.

2: All geometric elements of the current mask are listed here.

3: They are displayed in this window.

4: And can be added and removed with the +/- buttons.

The available masks are:

a: Arc: Allows to create pie or ring like shapes.

b: Square: For rectangular shapes.

c: Triangle: For isosceles triangles.

d: Linear comp.: Create a parent element of rectangular shape. Define how many child elements should be placed within each dimension (horizontal/vertial multiplicity). The child elements can be "square", "arc" and "triangle" from above. The option "close gap" chooses the width and heigth in a way, that no gaps are left. "Increment" gives each mask another color (or index).
